# ai-assisted-human-built
A fully responsive website showcasing a Spine 3D character (from the Spine community), built with handcrafted HTML/CSS and integrated animations. This project explores the intersection of AI capabilities and human creativity — highlighting what thoughtful, developer-driven design can achieve beyond automated prompts.
# 🌐 AI vs Human Web — Spine 3D Responsive Website

A fully responsive and visually engaging website built with **HTML**, **CSS**, **Spine 3D animation**, and **AOS (Animate On Scroll)** for scroll-based effects.

This project is my creative response to the trending belief that *"AI can replace web developers."*  
While AI can assist, it can't replace imagination, user empathy, or handcrafted design.
